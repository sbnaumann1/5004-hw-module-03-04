3. When you have one class referencing another object, such as storing that object as one of the attributes of the first class - what type of relationship is that called (between has-a and is-a)?

6. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?


7. What is the advantage of using an interface over an abstract class?

## Deeper Thinking 

Salary Inequality is a major issue in the United States. Even in STEM fields, women are often paid less for [entry level positions](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/whats-behind-pay-gap-stem-jobs). However, not paying equal salary can hurt representation in the field, and looking from a business perspective, can hurt the company's bottom line has diversity improves innovation and innovation drives profits. 

Having heard these facts, your employer would like data about their salaries to ensure that they are paying their employees fairly. While this is often done 'after pay' by employee surveys and feedback, they have the idea that maybe the payroll system can help them ensure that they are paying their employees fairly. They have given you free reign to explore this idea.

Think through the issue / making sure to cite any resources you use to help you better understand the topic. Then write a paragraph on what changes you would need to make to the system. For example, would there be any additional data points you would need to store in the employee file? Why? Consider what point in the payroll process you may want to look at the data, as different people could have different pretax benefits and highlight that. 

The answer to this is mostly open. We ask that you cite at least two sources to show your understanding of the issue. The TAs will also give feedback on your answer, though will be liberal in grading as long as you show a good faith effort to understand the issue and making an effort to think about how your design to could help meet your employer's goals of salary equity.
