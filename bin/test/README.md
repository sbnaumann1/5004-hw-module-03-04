# Unit Tests

Make sure you add unit tests to this folder.

Test Driven Development means you write the tests first, then write the code to make the tests pass.

In practice the steps end up being

1. Figure out a number of tests by brainstorming
2. Write **one** test
3. Write **just enough** code to make that test pass
4. Refactor/update case as you go along
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you have all the tests passing/fully built program

Often the first test has a lot of setup to build for classes and methods that don't exist yet. This is normal.

You will also refactor your code a lot as you go along. This is also normal.
